# f1_track_project
<h1>Main idea</h1>
Finding the shortest distance to complete various f1 tracks
<h2>Inital thoughts</h2>

1. Create a grid over a executable recentangle
2. Have grid size be variable
3. Import a f1 track
4. Create wall object over rectangle, if wall covers the grid do not go through that one
5. Create search algorithms to find shortest route through f1 race
6. Have search algorithms shown
7. Import real physics
8. Set f1 car limits and calculate best route per car
9. Possibly use machine learning for above to learn what speeds to drive at which moment with a speed limit based on car physics
